## Jun Tao, Sun Yat-sen University, China (SciVis)

<p> <strong> Title: </strong> Interactive Exploration of Flow Data </p>
<p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </p>
<p> The scale and complexity of flow data have been growing over the last decades. This renders the traditional flow visualization limited, as it require an overwheming amount of information to be presented in the screen with limited 2D space. To tackle this challenge, interactive exploration techniques allow users to specify the structures of interest for visualization and reduce the visual complexity. In this talk, we will discuss the research in interactive flow visualization using two of our recent work as examples. Our discussion will focus on two aspects: how the abstract space may help to observe and interact with the complicated flow structures, and how the emerging interaction techniques can be applied to the flow visualization. </p>

## Naoko Sawada, Mitsubishi Electronic, Japan (SciVis)

<p> <strong> Title: </strong> Exploration of New Features in Multi-Dimensional Time-Dependent Datasets Using Clustering </p>
<p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </p>
<p> TThe exploration of hidden universalities is one of the challenging tasks in time-series analysis. In this talk, I will present multi-dimensional subsequence time-series clustering and a visual analytics framework for the clustering results. These approaches effectively work on examining observable time variation patterns in long-term datasets. The clustering method challenges issues of multi-dimensional subsequence time-series clustering, such as the cluster prototype definition, the similarity measurement between subsequences, the way to obtain less-overlapping subsequences, etc. I demonstrate how effectively the method enhances users’ insights into datasets through a case study for the analysis of photo-polarimetric and near-infrared observation datasets of blazars, which was conducted in a visual analytics environment for blazar datasets, termed TimeTubesX. </p>

## Chenhui Li, East China Normal University, China (VA)

<p> <strong> Title: </strong> Real-time Visual Query of Spatiotemporal Data Distribution via Density Dictionary Learning </p>
<p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </p>
<p> Visual query of spatiotemporal data is becoming an increasingly important function in visual analytics applications. Various works have been presented for querying large spatiotemporal data in real time. However, the real-time query of spatiotemporal data distribution is still an open challenge. As spatiotemporal data become larger, methods of aggregation, storage and querying become critical. In this talk, we introduce a new visual query system that creates a low-memory storage component and provides real-time visual interactions of spatiotemporal data. </p>

## Rei Takami, Yahoo, Japan (InfoVis)

<p> <strong> Title: </strong> Visual Analytics for the Formulation of Evaluation Metrics for Multi-dimensional Time-series Data </p>
<p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </p>
<p> In many domains, such as medical and sports, the importance of multi-dimensional time-series data is increasing. To quantitatively evaluate current situations and the quality of those data, evaluation metrics (e.g., KPIs) are expected to play an important role. However, it is difficult for domain experts to formulate metrics, especially for data with high dimensionality and temporal characteristics. I will explain a visual analytics interface to support those tasks in a human-in-the-loop manner. </p>
