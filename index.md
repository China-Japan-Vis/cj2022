The China-Japan Joint Visualization Workshop aims to bring together visualization researchers in China and Japan to share their recent work on emerging topics in Visualization. The objective of the workshop is to promote the greater exchange of research, and to explore collaboration opportunities in the development of visualization and visual analytics between the two countries. In the past, the workshop was successfully held in Beijing, China (2017), Kobe, Japan (2018), Chengdu, China (2019), and Wuhan, China (2021).

The 5th Workshop will be held online on Thursday, April 14, 2022. It consists of 6 invited talks and panel discussions. We invited three young researchers from both China and Japan to attend this workshop and share their research, insight and experience.

Registration is made available via this [Registration Form](http://chinavis.org/cj2022/register/).
